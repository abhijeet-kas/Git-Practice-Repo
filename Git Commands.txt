A. Setting up repo First time:

	Step 1: Local setup:

		1. initialize the local repo to get tracked by github

			- git init

	Step 2: Remote setup:

		1. Add a name to your new repo using which you can refer it

			- Git remote add <remote-name> <repo url>

	Step 3: Push setup first time:

		1. Set upstream to always push in this branch

			- git push --set-upstream <repo-name> <branch-name> 

			- After this we can just type git push and it will push to this branch

Note: Sometimes Git doesn't allows to push if we don't have master branch in local. 
	- Thus, Always setup everything in master branch in local first while setting up you repo first time. 


B. Git Push

	1. Push Current local branch to remote 

		- Git push <remote-repo-name> <remote-branch-name>

	2. Push All branches to remote

		- Git push <remote-repo-name> --all

	3. Push from one local branch to another branch in remote:

		- git push <repo-name> <local-branch-name> : <remote-branch-name>

C. Creating a branch:

	1. Creating in loacl:

		- git branch - <new-branch-name>

		- git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

	2. Creating in remote:

		- git push <repo-name> <new-branch-name>

D. Deleting a branch

	1. Delete in local
	
		- git branch -d <branch-name>

	2. Delete in remote repo

		- git push <remote-repo-name> --delete <remote-branch-name>

E. Remote Repo setup:

	1. Removing a remote repo mapping with a local repo

		- git remote remove <remote-repo-name>

	2. Changing the url of remote branch for your local

		- git remote set-url <repo-name> <new-repo-url>

	3. Add a new remote repo to you local to push code into it:

		- Git remote add <remote-name> <repo url>

F. Cloning a remote repo to local:

	1. Cloning main branch:

		- Git clone <repo-url>

	2. Cloning specific branch:

		- Git clone --branch <remote-branch-name> <repo-url>

	3. Cloning all branches:

		- Step 1: Git Clone <repo-url>

		- Step 2: Retrieve or Fetch all branches from remote 
		
			- Git fetch --all

		- Step 3: Track all branches using below command: (create a local branch for each remote branch)

			- git branch -r | grep -v '\->' | while read remote; do git branch --track "${remote#origin/}" "$remote"; done

			- it is a bash command where | symbol pts output of one command into input of other command

		- Step 4: Git pull -all
